# -AI-Driven-Content-Performance-
Ever wondered how to turn your content chaos into CMO-ready insights, without the spreadsheet migraines? What if you could automate the grunt work, surface hidden trends, and deliver boardroom-worthy analytics—all powered by Azure AI and GPT-4?
 
**Overview:**
Here I've created a real-world solution for transforming manual, siloed content analytics into an AI-driven, automated insights engine.
This project was developed to showcase how modern marketers can leverage Azure AI Studio, GPT-4, and cloud automation to make smarter decisions, faster.

**Problem:**
Manual content reporting is slow, inconsistent, and often delivers too little, too late.

**Solution:**
AgentC automates the entire pipeline—from data ingestion and classification to performance analysis, anomaly detection, and CMO-ready executive summaries.

**Features:**

_Automated Data Ingestion:_
Upload raw content data (Excel, CSV, or cloud files) from multiple channels—no manual copy-paste required.

_AI-Based Content Classification & Tagging:_
Instantly categorize assets by format (blog, guide, webinar, etc.), topic (CX, AI, Workplace), and channel using Azure Cognitive Services and GPT-4-powered text analysis.

_Performance Pattern Analysis:_
Aggregate views, leads, conversions, and engagement by format and topic. Identify what’s driving results and what isn’t.

_Anomaly & Trend Detection:_
Surface outliers, sudden spikes/drops, and unexpected trends with AI-powered detection tools. See both wins and risks—before they impact the business.

_Executive Insights & Automated Dashboards:_
Generate and deliver boardroom-ready summaries, monthly trend reports, and actionable recommendations for the CMO and team.

_Continuous Feedback Loop:_
Capture executive/team feedback, refine tagging and analytics, and continuously improve the process and models.
